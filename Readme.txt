Welcome to my Simple Login Page project! This is a small practice project where I am honing my skills in HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to create a clean and responsive login page using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or backend functionality.

This project is purely for educational purposes and serves as a demonstration of my ability to structure and style a basic web page.

Features
Simple and Clean Design: A minimalistic login page with a focus on usability and aesthetics.

Responsive Layout: The page is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Custom Styling: Utilizes custom CSS for styling, including gradients, shadows, and hover effects.

No JavaScript: This project does not include any JavaScript or backend functionality. It is purely front-end.
